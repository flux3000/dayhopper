DayHopper

With DayHopper, you can create your own customized, ordered plan for your day. Once your plan is created, you can review it and modify it afterwards as well. We have already added a number of recommended things to see, eat, and do in San Francisco if you need suggestions!

Known bugs
- it is possible to submit an empty trail name or link (need validation code).
- After creating new trail and adding items, 'trail' meta tags are mistakenly displayed until the page is refreshed.
- When a new link is added with both "see" and "do" tags, it only shows up in one of the recommended lists (not both).
